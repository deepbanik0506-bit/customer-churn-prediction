📊 Customer Churn Prediction
🎯 Objective

Build a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecom company.

🧠 Problem Statement

Customer churn leads to revenue loss. The goal is to identify customers likely to leave so that retention strategies can be applied.

📁 Dataset

Synthetic Telecom Customer Churn Dataset (100,000 records).

⚙️ Steps Performed

Data cleaning & preprocessing

One-hot encoding for categorical variables

Stratified train-test split

Logistic Regression & Random Forest models

Class imbalance handling

Decision threshold tuning

Model evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score

🏆 Final Model

Balanced Logistic Regression (threshold = 0.5)

Accuracy: ~69%

Recall (Churn): ~70%

Precision (Churn): ~52%

📌 Key Insight

Lowering the decision threshold increased recall significantly, demonstrating the trade-off between detecting churners and minimizing false positives.
